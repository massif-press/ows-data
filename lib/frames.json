    "description": "The Gilgamesh is Harrison Armory's multirole Legionnaire model chassis, designed to be distributed to Armory legions and Acquisition & Management Teams across the Purview and beyond. Built to be fully compatible with numerous hardpoint-mounted tactical system enhancements and munitions, the Gilgamesh excels at no one task in particular, but its comprehensive modular construction and rugged engineering allow it to perform a variety of combat duties without difficulty within numerous theaters. Beyond the logistical efficiency of a standardized, easy to handle chassis meant to streamline both materiel concerns and aptitude training across multiple worlds and cultures, the Gilgamesh has another purpose as well; further reducing the Armory's remaining dependence on foreign-manufactured chassis designs, in particular the GMS Everest.<br><br>Some commissioned officers have a tendency to look down upon Gilgamesh pilots for using what they view as an unglamorous \"trainer\" chassis, but other commanders are fierce proponents of the design, even choosing to pilot it themselves in order to lead by example, and in certain regions of the Purview the Gilgamesh is regarded with as much admiration as more sophisticated models such as the Sherman.",

The end result is a deceptively elegant design capable of not only extensive customization but also exceptionally simple field repairs. A series of interlocking clamps and explosive bolts anchor various exoframe components and appendages in place, and when sufficient structural integrity is compromised these sections can be swiftly jettisoned and just as quickly replaced, allowing Legionnaires to continue fighting through catastrophic damage that would render other chassis inoperable.<br><br>This construction also allows power to be selectively rerouted between the core chassis and exoframe components, bypassing system failures and even enhancing overall performance for brief periods, though the strain this puts on the exoframe necessarily limits its use to critical situations only.",

The resulting design is far less dangerous for the pilot, and far more capable of concealing its signature as well as the full extent of its capabilities, allowing it to operate with greater discretion until absolutely necessary.<br><br>As a result, the Lycan excels at ambush and counter-ambush tactics, capable of masquerading as a more conventional chassis until the opportunity presents itself, then shedding its baffle-lined outer carapace and shifting into a hyper-aggressive close-combat mode in order to dispatch its targets.",

This transformation is dramatic and known to cause panic among enemy forces as the Lycan's true nature is suddenly revealed in an explosive jettisoning of armor plating and a violent surge of power diverted towards the chassis' concealed shock claws, a series of retractable, high-temperature arc blades based on Manticore armament designs and embedded with a series of retaliatory \"self-sharpening\" heuristics.",
